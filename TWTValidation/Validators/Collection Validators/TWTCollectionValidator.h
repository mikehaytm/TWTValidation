/*!
 TWTCollectionValidators validate a collection’s count and elements. To iterate over a collection’s elements,
 collection validators use fast enumeration. As such, TWTCollectionValidator is primarily intended for
 validating arrays, sets, and the like. For keyed collections like dictionaries and map tables, use
 TWTKeyedCollectionValidator.

 Values that are nil or the NSNull instance do not pass validation with collection validators.

 Collection validators are immutable objects. As such, sending -copy or -copyWithZone: to a collection
 validator will simply return the validator itself.
