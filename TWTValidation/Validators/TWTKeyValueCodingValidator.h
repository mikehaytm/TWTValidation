/*! 
 TWTKeyValueCodingValidators validate the values for a subset of an object’s key-value compliant keys. This 
 subset of keys is called the validator’s key set. When validating an object O, the validator iterates over 
 each key K in its key set and asks the object for the set of validators to use to validate K’s
 corresponding value. It does this by invoking +twt_validatorsForKey: on O’s class object. If that method
 does not return nil, the validator uses the returned validators to validate K’s corresponding value. Otherwise,
 it validates the value using O’s implementation of -validateValue:forKey:error:. This is repeated for each key
 in the validator’s key set. An object is considered valid only if all validations pass.
 
 Key-Value Coding validators are immutable objects. As such, sending -copy or -copyWithZone: to a key-value 
 coding validator will simply return the validator itself.

/*!
 The TWTKeyValueCodingValidator category on NSObject declares a single method, +twt_validatorsForKey:, which
 TWTKeyValueCodingValidator instances use to get the validators to validate the values for an object’s KVC-
 compliant keys.
 
 Typically, instead of overriding +twt_validatorsForKey:, subclasses should implement +twt_validatorsFor«Key»,
 with «Key» being the capitalized form of the KVC key. The base implementation of +twt_validatorsForKey: simply
 checks to see the receiver responds to that message, and if so, invokes it.

/*!
 @abstract Returns the validators that should be used for the specified KVC key.
 @discussion The base implementation checks if the receiver responds to +twt_validatorsFor«Key», and if so,
     returns the result of sending the receiver that message. Subclass implementations should take care to
     invoke their superclass’s implementation to retain this behavior.
 @param key A key for which instances of the receiver are key-value coding compliant.
 @result A set of validators that should be used to validate the value for the specified KVC key.
