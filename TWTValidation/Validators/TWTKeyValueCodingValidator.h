/*! 
 TWTKeyValueCodingValidators validate the values for a subset of an object’s key-value coding compliant keys. 
 This subset of keys is called the validator’s key set. When validating an object O, the validator iterates 
 over each key K in its key set and asks O for the set of validators to use to validate K’s corresponding value.
 It does this in a three-stage process. First, it sends O the -twt_validatorsForKey: message. If O responds with
 a set of validators, those are used to validate K’s corresponding value. If it responds with nil, the validator
 will send the +twt_validatorsForKey: message to O’s class. If this returns a non-nil set of validators, those 
 are used to perform validation. Otherwise, the validator validates the value using O’s implementation of 
 -validateValue:forKey:error:. This is repeated for each key in the validator’s key set. An object is considered
 valid only if all validations pass.

 Values that are nil or the NSNull instance do not pass validation with key-value coding validators.

 Key-Value Coding validators are immutable objects. As such, sending -copy or -copyWithZone: to a key-value 
 coding validator will simply return the validator itself.

/*!
 The TWTKeyValueCodingValidator category on NSObject declares a two method, -twt_validatorsForKey: and 
 +twt_validatorsForKey:, which TWTKeyValueCodingValidator instances use to get the validators for an object’s
 KVC-compliant keys.
 
 Typically, instead of overriding -twt_validatorsForKey: and +twt_validatorsForKey:, subclasses should implement
 -twt_validatorsFor«Key» or +twt_validatorsFor«Key», with «Key» being the capitalized form of the KVC key. The
 base implementations of -twt_validatorsForKey: and +twt_validatorsForKey: simply check to see the receiver 
 responds to the key-specific form of the message, and if so, returns the value of that.
 
 -twt_validatorsForKey: is meant to return validators that depend on the runtime state of an object. If your
 object’s validators are static, it is better ot use +twt_validatorsForKey:, as these validators can be cached
 by the validation system. You can, of course, use a combination of the two methods if some of your keys have
 static validators while others depend on runtime state. Note however that if -twt_validatorsForKey: returns
 a non-nil object for a given key, +twt_validatorsForKey: will not be invoked for the same key.
